<p>My name is Jan Stevens. I'm a full stack developer based in Antwerp.
  I'm fascinated by technology and finding solutions for complex problems.
  I've build software in React / Rails / Ruby / Postgres / GraphQL / Elixir.
</p>

<p>I'm a jack of all trades that easily picks up new technology and
  successfully applies it in production. From building full stack applications to cross compiling
  Android for ARM Point of Sales devices. At PlayPass I've build access control software for festivals (Rock Werchter) and large venues (Sportpaleis).
  At November Five I shifted my focus on frontend technologies. Using React we transform designs to interactive frontend applications.
</p>

<p>In my free time I like to go swimming and walking.
  I'm a typical Belgium Burgundian who likes good food with a glass of wine.
  My personality is best described as straight forward with a sprinkle of sarcasm.
